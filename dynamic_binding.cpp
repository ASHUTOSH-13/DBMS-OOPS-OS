// what is dynamic binding?
// In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to the function call is decided at runtime.
// C++ has virtual functions to support this. Because dynamic binding is flexible, it avoids the drawbacks of static binding,
// which connected the function call and definition at build time.
